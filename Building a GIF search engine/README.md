Why React 
A lot of people are excited about react, Facebook new JAVASCRIPT Framework.
Big companies, among them Netflix, Yahoo...
are making React a critical part of their stack, and it seems like more and more developers are singing its praises.

## The fundamentals of React :
To understand React, you need to think in terms of self-contained components. A component is a module that contains all of the HTML and JS it needs.

The app we are going to create takes text input from a search field and returns a list of individual gifs. this can be broken down into four seperate React components.

{ App : {
            {Search bar : inputText}
            {Gif List : {Gif Item : Image}}

        }

}
